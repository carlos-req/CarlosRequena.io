              <p>My name is Carlos, I am a software engineer with a passion for front end applications. I started tinkering with technology when I was just 8 years olds. I was an avid gamer growing up and still am to this day. I took up a lot of graphic design and <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv6kEnRI6tU&ab_channel=DragoVFX" target="_blank">VFX</a> work at the age of 14, so much so I used to get hired for it. I have a huge passion for it as well as gaming. My current passions are working out, walking my corgi, eating food & coding. I had a career change from nursing school to coding. Once I found coding, I absolutely fell in love with it. I have spent the last year self-teaching as well as attending college for web development and plan to pursue a bachelor's in technology and management.</p>

          <p class="description">This was my first JavaScript project, that I manipulated the DOM and I really enjoyed it, though it could have went better it was my first time using the New Date() method and understand how to set that up in terms of PM/AM as well as 12 Hour times. I am hoping to continue to take the lesson from this one to my next project.</p>

          <p class="description">This was a fun little project which I did to test my JavaScript skills, I was very excited about how little documentation I had to look at to complete this project and also how efficient I was at completing this project, I really enjoy adding functionality to my HTML & CSS. I would like to incorporate something like this in my next website.</p>

            <p class="description">This was my latest front end mentor challenge. This  project really pushed me to understand a lot of CSS concepts as well as helped me understand spacing for appealing UX design. I really enjoyed the colors in this project. I also worked along side my coding community, which made this special.</p>
